# YouNiversity README.md
The project is called YouNiversity; a portmanteau of you and university. Prospective students around the world experience barriers when embarking on the journey of finding the right university for them. These barriers range from prospective students experiencing anxiety to zero-motivation and are compounded by university websites not being centralised. A centralised universities website will break-down some of these barriers experienced by prospective students. YouNiversity is a minimum-viable-product that takes a userâ€™s input of a country or city and then displays the names of all the universities in that country or city as clickable links to their websites. Users of YouNiversity will then be able to apply directly to universities on their websites or save university websites to a database for later selection.
